# DomainChecker

It Will Check All 3Letter and 2Letter Domains , Actually .ir webs

it doesn't generate Domains , It Uses .txt file.

Here We Have "Optimize Txt Urls.py" which will convert .txt Domains to A List In .py Format.

So there is 2 .py Filse "URLS.py" which has All 3Letter Domains and "URLS2.py" which contains all 2Letter Domains.

You should Run "Check All.py" or "Check All2.py" and The Avaible Domains Will be in "FREES.py" and "FREES2.py"

It Is Powered By Selenium and After Each Try , it will Show the Duration Time of Checking and Count.
